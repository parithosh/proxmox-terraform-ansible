# Setting up and using Ansible

Ansible allows for using dynamic inventory, this inventory can be a simple python script. 

- No extra dependencies are needed besides those specified in `pyproject.toml`. `poetry install` installs the deps.
- Configure the credentials in `proxmox.json`.  
- An example ansible inventory can be found here: `ansible-example/inventory/proxmox.py`, edit the `project_filters` and 
`FetchPublicIPAddress` function (Reason described below).
- The dynamic inventory can be generated then with `ansible-inventory -i <PATH>/inventory/proxmox.py --list`.
- Test ping with `ansible -i <PATH>/inventory/proxmox.py -m ping all`
- Run an example ansible-playbook to confirm that you can reach the VMs and run playbooks against them.
  
Note:
  While the inventory queries the public API endpoint, the ansible scripts are run on the VMs themselves. These VMs
will only return a `private subnet IP` and our system will not have a path to it. Which is why we need to use
the jump host method of connecting to the VMs. Make sure that you have SSH access(ideally via key) via `USERNAME@PROXMOX-HOST-IP`.
TL;DR: All the traffic will essentially "jump" through the proxmox host to the VM you want to interact with
