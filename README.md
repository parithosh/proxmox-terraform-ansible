# Proxmox-Terraform-Ansible

This repo can be used to set up your own mini-cloud. The idea is to use dedicated infrastructure and install
our own virtualization engine, This engine can then be used in combination with Terraform and Ansible to 
create an experience similar to just using any other cloud service provider. 

# End goal:
Once the proxmox host and env has been setup correctly, a user can use terraform to create a series of VMs/containers
in any of the hosts and later use ansible to configure the VM. 

# How to use this repo:
- Follow the numbered guides in order
