# Setting up proxmox for automation
While the proxmox GUI is great for getting an overview, it is horrible for repetitive tasks and large workloads. We need
some automation. We can use Terraform to create the VMs and Ansible to provision the instances.

### Terraform

Terraform is used by EF devops to create and manage instances. Proxmox has a community plugin known as "Telmate/proxmox"
that can be used with Terraform. Have a look at the terraform example in `terraform-example/environment/example/main.tf`.
Another detailed example can be found here: https://yetiops.net/posts/proxmox-terraform-cloudinit-saltstack-prometheus/


## Pre-requisite
Before we use terraform, we need to create a template that we can base our images off of. This is similar to an
AMI on AWS. Follow this guide for creating an image: https://yetiops.net/posts/proxmox-terraform-cloudinit-saltstack-prometheus/
WARNING!!! After importing the disk image to proxmox storage, you will see a path where the image was imported. Use that
path to attach the disk to the virtual machine. Otherwise you will just get storage errors and cannot use the template.

WARNING!!! make sure you set a "unique" name for the template, ideally "name-$NAME-OF-NODE" or so. Having the same template
name across multiple nodes leads to a `500 non-shared storage` error since terraform tries to use a template
that is in a different host. Using unique names and setting it in the resource avoids this problem entirely.

E.g:
```
Run:
qm importdisk 9001 debian-10-openstack-amd64.qcow2 local
Output: Successfully imported disk as unused0:local:9001/vm-9001-disk-0.raw
And then: qm set 9001 -scsihw virtio-scsi-pci -virtio0 local:9001/vm-9001-disk-0.raw
```

## Instructions
1. Terraform requires a username:password to authenticate itself against the API, so create the requisite pair in the GUI
2. Add the `pm_url`,`pm_user` and `pm_password` directly in the `main.tf` OR export them to your env by 
   setting `TF_VAR_pm_user`,`TF_VAR_pm_password`,`TF_VAR_pm_api_url`
3. Modify the information in your `main.cf` to match your environment and needs. Target node refers to the physical proxmox
   node on which the VM needs to be created. So you would need one module per region. 
4. Run `terraform init` to init the provider
5. The terraform file `main.tf` uses `cloud-init` to provision the instance from a "Template image" and then runs custom
   scripts,creates users, SSH keys, etc. look at `terraform-example/modules/instances/resource.tf`
   and `terraform-example/environment/example/files/cloud_init_deb10.cloud_config`.

Note: Terraform doesn't explicitly create "Tags" with the proxmox provider, instead the tags can be saved as a string
in the "Description" field of proxmox.
