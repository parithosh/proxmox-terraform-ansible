# Set up port forwards

The VMs are inside their own VM subnet and have no direct route to the outside world. This means they can only have outgoing
traffic. While this is fine for most usecases, it breaks down with eth2 nodes. Eth2 nodes use discv5 to handle finding peers,
in the absence of something like `upnp`, they would not be able to connect to any peers since they are completely isolated
to incoming traffic. 

The solution for this would be to simply setup a port forward from the host public IP to the subnet IP. We can then 
advertise the port as the `p2p-udp-port/p2p-tcp-port` via CLI flags to ensure connectivity. Naturally we don't want the ports
to overlap, so we always use a pre-defined offset (9000) + `vmid` (which is unique for each VM).

I've created a script to simplify the process, it creates a basic script with `iptables` to setup this route.

## Instructions
- Navigate to `scripts/proxmox-port-forwarding/inventory`
- Install dependencies with `poetry install`
- Run the script with:
`python3 proxmox-port-forwarding/inventory/proxmox.py --url=https://URL:8006/ --username=USERNAME@pve --password=PASSWORD --qemu_interface=ens18 --trust-invalid-certs --list --pretty`
- Move the generated `port-forwarding-script-NODE-NAME.sh` to the proxmox host with `scp` or whatever.
- Run `chmod +x port-forwarding-script-NODE-NAME.sh` and manually verify the script
- Run the script with `./port-forwarding-script-NODE-NAME.sh`
- Verify the forwards with `iptables -vnxL -tnat`

NOTE: You would need to redo the port forwards each time you setup a new VM that requires the port forward
